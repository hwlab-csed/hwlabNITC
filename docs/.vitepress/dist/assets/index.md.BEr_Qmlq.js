In this course, you will learn about Verilog in detail, including its syntax, data types, modules, behavioral modeling, and structural modeling. You will also understand how to simulate and test your Verilog designs and further run basic MIPS instructions using your own Single Cycle program.</p></li><li><p><code>Introduction to MIPS ISA</code> - MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture commonly used in embedded systems and educational environments. In this course, you will dive into the details of the MIPS architecture, including its instruction set, registers, memory organization, and execution flow. You will also learn how to write MIPS assembly code and understand the basic concepts of computer organization and architecture.</p></li></ul><h2 id="course-layout" tabindex="-1"><strong>Course Layout</strong> <a class="header-anchor" href="#course-layout" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;**Course Layout**&quot;">​</a></h2><p>This tutorial is split into a 2 parts for each topic-</p><ol><li><p><strong>Theory</strong> - This part focuses on the theoretical concepts and principles of the topic. You will find comprehensive documentation and video explanation that covers the fundamental ideas, techniques, and best practices related to Verilog and MIPS. These resources will provide you with a solid understanding of the topics and their applications.</p></li><li><p><strong>Implementation</strong> - This part emphasizes the practical aspect of the course. You will find documentation and video tutorials that guide you through the implementation of Verilog designs and MIPS assembly code. This hands-on approach will help you gain practical skills and experience in designing and working with digital systems using Verilog and MIPS.</p></li></ol><p>By following this course layout, you will have a well-rounded understanding of Verilog and MIPS, both from a theoretical and practical perspective.</p>',8),r=[n];function s(l,d,c,u,h,p){return o(),t("div",null,r)}const w=e(a,[["render",s]]);export{m as __pageData,w as default};
