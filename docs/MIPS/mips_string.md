# **MIPS**

## **String Operations**

Strings in MIPS can be declared as constant in the _.data_ part of the program. They are often stored
this way so that they can be used as user prompts or to format output of a program. Strings can also
be entered by the user during the runtime of the program. Both methods of using strings in MIPS
will be demonstrated below.

**1. Entering string constants**

Pre-determined strings enclosed by double quotes can be declared in the _.data_ section.

_Code to store the string “enter an element:” in memory under the name “message”:_

```asm
.data
message: .asciiz “enter an element:”
```

**2. Enter strings as input from the user**

To enter strings as input, the syscall code to be used is 8. Apart from that, the address of the
memory space into which the string must be entered, is loaded into the $a0 register. The
maximum size of the string must also be loaded into the $a1 register before performing the
syscall.

_Code to read a string as input from the user:_

```asm
.data
input: .space 100
inputsize: .word 100
.text
li $v0, 8
la $a0, input
lw $a1, inputsize
syscall
```

**3. Printing strings stored in memory**

To print the required string, the syscall to be used is 4. The address of the string has to be
loaded into the $a0 register.

_Code to print a string named ‘message’ stored in memory:_

```asm
.text
li $v0, 4
la $a0, output
syscall
```

We have now learnt how to declare strings constants as well as how to store strings entered
by the user. We shall now write a program combining both the concepts for a more robust
understanding of basic string operations.

_Code to read a string, with prompts instructing the user:_

```asm
.text
main:
  # Prompt for the string to enter
  li $v0, 4
  la $a0, prompt
  syscall

  # Read the string.
  li $v0, 8
  la $a0, input
  lw $a1, inputSize
  syscall

  # Output the text
  li $v0, 4
  la $a0, output
  syscall

  # Output the number
  li $v0, 4
  la $a0, input
  syscall

  # Exit the program
  li $v0, 10
  syscall

.data
input:        .space 81
inputSize:    .word 80
prompt:       .asciiz "Please enter a string: "
output:       .asciiz "\nYou typed the string: "
```

### **Points To Note**

- The _.space_ directive allocates n bytes of memory in the data region of the program, where
  n=81 in this program. Since the size of a character is 1 byte, this is equivalent to saving 80
  characters for data. 81 was used here because in MIPS a sequence of ASCII characters is
  terminated by a null value (byte containing 0). This is known as a null terminator.

- If the string the user enters is larger than the maximum size of the string, it is truncated to
  the maximum size. This is to prevent the program from accessing memory not allocated to
  the string.

## **String Operations (Advanced)**

### **Null Character and Newline**

When strings are created by using user input (code 8 passed to $vo), it forms a sequence of ASCII
characters that are terminated by a newline character, followed by a NULL character. The newline
character is triggered by the pressing of enter key during user input.

_The ASCII code for newline is 10. Hence_ beq, $t1,10,label _can be used as a comparing instruction_

_MIPS treats NULL character as a zero. Hence_ beqz, $t1, label _can be used as a comparing instruction_

### **String Traversal**

Strings are made up of characters, in which each character occupies a byte. Hence, unlike an Integer
Array, each character must be traversed byte by byte.

Eg: To find the length of a string (newline character need not be included)

::: details View Code

```asm
# assume string is input to str1
li $s1,0 #loop counter (i)

len:
lb $t1,str1($s1)  # $t1=str[i]
beq $t1,10,start  # termination condition
addi $s1,$s1,1    # i=i+1
j len
start:
li $v0,1          # print len=i
move $a0,$s1
syscall
```

:::

_If the newline character needs to be included in the length, beq should be replaced with beqz_

### **String Concatenation**

Concatenation of two strings can be done using 2 loops. The presence of newline and null character
at the end of each string should be considered.

Consider two strings, str1 and str2. The following is the pseudocode and the code snippet for
concatenating str2 to str1:  
_Pseudo Code:_

```c
i=0

j=0

while str1[i]!='\n'

i++

while str2[j]!='\0'

str1[i]=str2[j]

i++

j++
```

i $s1,0           # i=0
li $s2,0           # j=0
loop1:
   lb $t1,str1($s1)
  beq $t1,10,loop2
  addi $s1,$s1,1           # i++
  j loop1
loop2:
  lb $t1,str2($s2)
  beqz $t1,end
  sb $t1,str1($s1)    # str1[i]=str[j]
  addi $s1,$s1,1      # i++
  addi $s2,$s2,1      # j++
  j loop2
end:
```

### **Palindrome Checking**

A palindrome sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards. Palindrome checking uses two
pointer method.

Assume a string str, whole length is n. Length of the string is calculated by previous method and
stored in $s1. The following code snippet shows the while loop necessary for checking whether the
string is palindrome

```asm
addi $s1,$s1,-1 # j=n-1
li $s0,0        # i=0
for:
  lb $t1,str($s0)
  lb $t2,str($s1)
  bge $s0,$s1,true    # if i>=j,exit loop. return True
  bne $t1,$t2,false   # if str[i]!=str[j], return False
  addi $s0,$s0,1      #  i++
  addi $s1,$s1,-1     #  j--
  j for
```
