## **Basic Definition And Formulations:**

An FSM is a digital sequential circuit that can follow a number of predefined
states under the control of one or more inputs. Each state is a stable entity that
the machine can occupy. It can move from this state to another state under the
control of an outside-world input.

<img src="/img/fsm-image-0010.png"><img/>

Some FSMs have a clock input and are called synchronous FSMs, i.e. those that
do not belong to a type of FSM called asynchronous FSMs.
Each state of the FSM needs to be identifiable. This is achieved by using a
number of internal (to the FSM block) flip-flops. An FSM with four states
would require two flip-flops, since two flip-flops can store 22 =4 state numbers.
Each state has a unique state number, and states are usually assigned numbers
as s0 (state 0), s1, s2, and s3 (for the four-state example).
The rule here is

**Number of states = 2<sup>(number of flip-flops)</sup>**
 or 
**Number of flip-flops = log<sub>2</sub>(number of states)**

### **State Table**
The time sequence of inputs, outputs, and flip-flop states may be enumerated in
a state table. The state table for the circuit of Fig. 1.2 is shown in Table 1.1. It
consists of three sections labeled present state, next state, and output. The
present state designates the states of flip-flops before the occurrence of a clock
pulse. The next state shows the states of flip-flops after the application of a
clock pulse, and the output section lists the values of the output variables during
the present state. Both the next state and output sections have two columns, one
for x = 0 and the other for x = 1.

### **State Equations**
A state equation (also known as an application equation) is an algebraic 
expression that specifies the conditions for a flip-flop state transition. The left 
side of the equation denotes the next state of a flip-flop and the right side, a 
Boolean function that specifies the present state conditions that make the next 
state equal to 1. A state equation is similar in form to a flip-flop characteristic
equation, except that it specifies the next state conditions in terms of external 
input variables and other flip-flop values. The state equation is derived directly 
from a state table. For example, the state equation for flip-flop A is derived 
from inspection of Table 1-1. From the next state columns, we note that flip-
flop A goes to the 1 state four times: when x = 0 and AB = 01 or 10 or 11, or 
when x = 1 and AB = 11. This can be expressed algebraically in a state equation
as follows:  
**A(t + 1) = (A′B + AB′ + AB) x′ + Abx**

### **State Diagram**
The information available in a state table may be represented graphically in a 
state diagram. In this diagram, a state is represented by a circle, and the 
transition between states is indicated by directed lines connecting the circles. 
The state diagram of the sequential circuit give in the [Section 1.1](#11-state-table) is shown below. The 
binary number inside each circle identifies the state the circle represents.
The directed lines are labeled with two binary numbers separated by a /. The 
input value that causes the state transition is labeled first; the number after the symbol / gives the value of the output during the present state. For example, the
directed line from state 00 to 01 is labeled 1/0, meaning that the sequential 
circuit is in a present state 00 while x = 1 and x = 0, and that on the
termination of the next clock pulse, the circuit goes to next state 01. A directed 
line connecting a circle with itself indicates that no change of state occurs. The 
state diagram provides the same information as the state table and is obtained 
directly from table in [Section 1.1](#11-state-table)

## **Types of Finite State Machines:**

### **Mealy Model**
n this model, the FSM has a number of inputs that connect to the Next State
Decoder (combinational) logic. The Q outputs of the memory element Flip-
Flops connect to the Output Decoder logic, which in turn connects to the 
Outside World Outputs. The Flip-Flops outputs are used as Next State inputs to 
the Next State Decoder, and it is these that determine the next state that the 
FSM will move to. Once the FSM has moved to this Next State, its Flip-Flops 
acquire a new Present State, as dictated by the Next State Decoder.
Note that some of the Outside World Inputs connect directly to the Output 
Decoder logic. This is the main feature of the Mealy-type FSM.

### **Moore Model**
Another architectural form for an FSM is the Moore FSM.
The Moore FSM [Section 2.2](#22-moore-model) differs from the Mealy FSM in that it does not 
have the feed-forward paths. This type of FSM is very common. Note that the 
Outside World Outputs are a function of the Flip-Flops outputs only (unlike the 
Mealy FSM architecture, where the Outside World Outputs are a function of 
Flip-Flops outputs and some Outside World Inputs).

## **Pre-Requisite Verilog Commands:**
### **Initial**
A set of Verilog statements are usually executed sequentially in a simulation. 
These statements are placed inside a procedural block. Initial is one of the two 
main types of procedural block statements. An initial block is not synthesizable 
and hence cannot be converted into a hardware schematic with digital elements.
Hence initial blocks do not serve much purpose than to be used in simulations. 
These blocks are primarily used to initialize variables and drive design ports 
with specific values.This block will be executed only once during the entire 
simulation. Execution of an initial block finishes once all the statements within 
the block are executed.  
The syntax is shown below:  
```v
initial
  [single statement]

initial begin
  [multiple statement]
end
```  
### **Always**
An always block is one of the procedural blocks in Verilog. Statements inside 
an always block are executed sequentially. The always block is executed at 
some particular event defined in the sensitivity list.
A sensitivity list is the expression that defines when the always block should be 
executed and is specified after the @ operator within parentheses ( ) . This
list may contain either one or a group of signals whose value change will 
execute the always block.
An always block can be used to realize combinational or sequential elements. A 
sequential element like flip flop becomes active when it is provided with a clock
and reset. Similarly, a combinational block becomes active when one of its nput values change. These hardware blocks are all working concurrently 
independent of each other. The connection between each is what determines the 
flow of data. To model this behavior, an always block is made as a continuous 
process that gets triggered and performs some action when a signal within the
sensitivity list becomes active. The syntax is displayed in [Section 2.2](#22-moore-model)  

```v
always @ (event)
  [statement]

always @ (event) begin
  [multiple statement]
end
```

### **Begin..End**
Statements are wrapped using begin and end keywords and will be executed 
sequentially in the given order, one after the other. Delay values are
treated relative to the time of execution of the previous statement. After all the 
statements within the block are executed control may be passed elsewhere. The 
syntax is shown in [Section 3.3](#33-beginend)

```v
begin : name_seq
  [statements]
end
```

### **Fork..Join**

Statements are launched in parallel by wrapping them within the join and fork
keywords. A parallel block can execute statements concurrently and delay 
control can be used to provide time-ordering of the assignments. The syntax is 
shown in [Section 3.4](#34-forkjoin)

```v
fork : name_fork
  [statements]
join
```

### **Blocking Statements**
Blocking assignment statements are assigned using = and are executed one after
the other in a procedural block. However, this will not prevent execution of 
statments that run in a parallel block. For eg

```v
module tb;
  reg[7:0] a, b, c, d, e;

  initial begin
    a = 8'hDA;
    $display("[%0t] a=0x%0h b=0x0%h c=0x0%h", $time);

    b = 8'hF1;
    $display("[%0t] a=0x%0h b=0x0%h c=0x0%h", $time);

    c = 8'h30
    $display("[%0t] a=0x%0h b=0x0%h c=0x0%h", $time);
  end

  initial begin
    d = 8'hAA;
    $display("[%0t] d=0x0%h e=0x0%h", $time, d, e);

    e = 8'h55;
    $display("[%0t] d=0x0%h e=0x0%h", $time, d, e);
  end
endmodule
```

In the above example, there are two initial blocks which are executed in parallel
when simulation starts. Statements are executed sequentially in each block
and both blocks finish at time 0ns. To be more specific, variable a gets assigned 
first, followed by the display statement which is then followed by all other
statements.

### **Non-Blocking Statements**

Non-blocking assignment allows assignments to be scheduled without blocking 
the execution of following statements and is specified by a <= symbol. It's
interesting to note that the same symbol is used as a relational operator in 
expressions, and as an assignment operator in the context of a non-blocking
assignment. The following code snippet is written by replacing all the blocking 
statements in the previous example by non blocking statements. Try out for 
yourself and compare the difference in the outputs :-) .

```v
module tb;
  reg[7:0] a, b, c, d, e;

  initial begin
    a <= 8'hDA;
    $display("[%0t] a=0x%0h b=0x0%h c=0x0%h", $time);

    b <= 8'hF1;
    $display("[%0t] a=0x%0h b=0x0%h c=0x0%h", $time);

    c <= 8'h30
    $display("[%0t] a=0x%0h b=0x0%h c=0x0%h", $time);
  end

  initial begin
    d <= 8'hAA;
    $display("[%0t] d=0x0%h e=0x0%h", $time, d, e);

    e <= 8'h55;
    $display("[%0t] d=0x0%h e=0x0%h", $time, d, e);
  end
endmodule
```  

### **Posedge and Negedge**

Simply speaking,
posedge means the transition from 0 to 1 
negedge the oposit transition from 1 to 0 
In synchronous sequential circuits, changes in flip-flops
occur only in response to a transition of a clock pulse. The transition may be 
either a positive edge or a negative edge of the clock, but not both. Verilog HDL
takes care of these conditions by providing these two keywords viz. posedge 
and negedge. The syntax is shown in [Section 3.7](#37-posedge-and-negedge)
```v
always@(posedge clock, negedge reset);
```

### **Case Statement**

The case statement checks if the given expression matches one of the other 
expressions in the list and branches accordingly. It is typically used to 
implement a multiplexer. The if-else construct may not be suitable if there are 
many conditions to be checked and would synthesize into a priority encoder 
instead of a multiplexer.

```v
// Here 'expression' should match one of the lines
case(<expression>)
  case_item1  : <single statement>
  case_item2,
  case_item3  : begin
                <multiple statement>
              end
  default     : <statement>
endcase 
```
The syntax is shown in [Section 3.8](#38-case-statement). A Verilog case statement starts with the 
keyword case and ends with the endcase keyword. The expression within 
parantheses will be evaluated exactly once and is compared with the list of
alternatives in the order they are written and the statements for which the 
alternative matches the given expression are executed. A block of multiple
statements must be grouped and be within begin and end. 
If none of the case items match the given expression, statements within the
default item is executed. The statement is optional, and there can be only one 
default statement in a case statement.

## **Examples of Implementing State Machines in Verilog:**
Now that we are all set and armed with the required amunition of verilog 
commands, let’s dive headfirst into implementing state machines using verilog.
This section will consist of four examples. Each example will consist of the 
problem statement, the state diagram, the verilog code and testbench and 
finally,the output of the code.
Try implementing these problems on your own first without referring to this 
manual. If yoou get stuck at any point, you can come back and take a peek ;-)
Remember, the key lies in understanding the state diagram thoroughly!!

### **Mealy Machine Implementations**
Let’s start our dive with a simple example of implementing a mealy machine. 
Recall that in a Mealy machine, the output is a function of both, the present 
state as well as the input. Let’s consider the example of a Mealy Zero Detector 
shown in [Section 4.1](#41-mealy-machine-implementations)  

### **Verilog Code:**
```v
module mealy_zero_det(
  output reg y_out,
  input x_in,clk,reset);

  reg [1:0] state,next_state;
  parameter S0 = 2'b00, S1 = 2'b01, S2 = 2'b10, S3 = 2'b11;

  always@(posedge clk,negedge reset)
    if (reset==0) state <= S0;
    else state<=next_state;

  always @ (state, x_in)
    case (state)
      S0: 
        if (x_in) next_state = S1; else next_state =S0; 
      S1:
        if (x_in) next_state = S3; else next_state =S0;
      S2: 
        if (~x_in) next_state = S0; else next_state = S2
      S3: 
        if (x_in) next_state = S2; else next_state=S0
    endcase

  always @ (state, x_in)
    case (state)
      S0:
        y_out = 0;
      S1, S2, S3: 
        y_out = ~x_in;
    endcase

endmodule
```

### **TestBench:**
```v
module mealy_zero_det_tb();
  wire t_y_out;
  reg t_x_in,t_clock,t_reset;  
  mealy_zero_det uut(t_y_out,t_x_in,t_clock,t_reset);initial #200 $finish;
  initial 
    begin 
      $dumpfile("dump.vcd");
      $dumpvars(1);
      t_clock = 0; 
      forever #5 t_clock = ~t_clock; 
    end
  initial 
    fork
      t_reset = 0;
      #2 t_reset = 1;
      #87 t_reset = 0;
      #89 t_reset = 1;
      #10 t_x_in = 1;
      #30 t_x_in = 0;
      #40 t_x_in = 1;
      #50 t_x_in = 0;
      #52 t_x_in = 1;
      #54 t_x_in = 0;
      #70 t_x_in = 1;
      #80 t_x_in = 1;
      #70 t_x_in = 0;
      #90 t_x_in = 1;
      #100 t_x_in = 0;
      #120 t_x_in = 1;
      #160 t_x_in = 0;
      #170 t_x_in = 1;
    join
endmodule
```

### **Moore Machine Implememtation**
Let’s try implementing the above example in Moore Model. The state diagram 
needs to be modified as in the Moore Model, the output depends only on the 
initial state. The state diagram will be as shown in [Section 4.2](#42-moore-machine-implememtation)

<img src="/img/fsm-image-0100.png"></img>  

### **Verilog Code:**
```v
module moore_zero_det (   
  output [1:0] y_out,
  input x_in, clock, reset
  );

  reg [1:0] state;
  parameter S0 = 2'b00, S1 = 2'b01, S2 = 2'b10, S3 = 2'b11;

  always @ (posedge clock, negedge reset)
    if (reset == 0)
      state <= S0;
    else
      case (state)
        S0: 
          if (~x_in)
            state <= S1;
          else
            state <= S0;
        S1: 
          if (x_in)
            state <= S2; 
          else               
            state <= S3;
        S2: 
          if (~x_in)               
            state <= S3;          
          else               
            state <= S2;
        S3: 
          if (~x_in)               
            state <= S0;          
          else               
            state <= S3;
      endcase
      
  assign y_out = state;
endmodule
```

### **Testbench:**
```v
module moore_zero_det_tb();
wire [1:0] t_y_out;
reg t_x_in,t_clock,t_reset;  
moore_zero_det uut(t_y_out,t_x_in,t_clock,t_reset);initial #200 $finish;
initial 
  begin 
    // Dump waves
    $dumpfile("dump.vcd");
    $dumpvars(1);
    t_clock = 0; 
    forever #5 t_clock = ~t_clock;
  end
    initial 
      fork
        t_reset = 0;
        #2 t_reset = 1;
        #87 t_reset = 0;
        #89 t_reset = 1;

### **Chess Clock Controller**
**Background:** At the start of a new game, the Reset input is asserted to initialize 
the system and clear both timers to zero time. This is achieved by means of the 
Clr output of the Chess Clock FSM being driven high, thereby asserting the 
reset (rst) input of both timers. Each chess player has a push-button, which 
when pressed applies a logic 1 to their respective inputs, Pa and Pb, of the 
Chess Clock FSM. After resetting the timers, the player who is not making the 
first move presses their push-button in order to enable the other player’s timer 
to commence timing.  
For example, if Player-A is to make the first move, then Player-B starts the 
game by pressing their push-button. This has the effect of activating the Ta 
output of the Chess Clock FSM block in order to enable TIMER-A to record the
time taken by Player-A to make the first move. Once Player-A completes the 
first move, Player-A’s button is pressed in order to stop their own timer and start
Player-B’s timer (Ta is negated and Tb is asserted)  
The state diagram of this machine is given in [Section 4.3](#43-chess-clock-controller)

<img src="/img/fsm-image-0119.png"></img>  
As shown, the FSM makes use of four states having the names shown in the 
upper half of the state circles. The states of the FSM outputs Ta, Tb and Clr are 
listed in the lower half of every state circle; those outputs preceded by ‘/’ are 
forced to logic 0, whereas those without ‘/’ are forced to logic 1. The presence 
of the output states within each of the state circles indicates that the Chess 
Clock FSM is of the Moore variety. The values of the inputs, Pa and Pb, are 
shown alongside each corresponding state transition path (arrow) using a format
similar to that used to show the state of the outputs. The movement from one 
state to another occurs on the rising edge of the Clock input. Where the number 
of transitions shown originating from a given state is less than the total number 
possible, the remaining input conditions result in a so-called sling, i.e. the next 
state is the same as the current state.

### **Verilog Code:**
```v
module chess_clk_cntrl(
  output time_a,time_b,clr,
  input player_a,player_b,clk,reset);
  
  localparam run_a=0,run_b=1,stop=2,Wait=3;
  reg [1:0] state;
  always@(posedge clk,posedge reset)

              2'b11: state<=Wait;
            endcase
          Wait:
            if(player_a==player_b) 
              state<=Wait;
          	else 
              if(player_a==1'b1)
                state<=run_b;
          	  else
                state<=run_a;
        endcase
    end
  assign time_a=state==run_a;
  assign time_b=state==run_b;
  assign clr=state==stop;
endmodule
```

### **Testbench:**
```v

  wire time_a,time_b,clr;
  reg player_a,player_b,clk,reset;
  chess_clk_cntrl 	uut(time_a,time_b,clr,player_a,player_b,clk,reset);

### **Vending Machine**  
Our vending machine is based on the following state diagram:

<img src="/img/fsm-image-0135.png"></img>  
The machine has the following states:
•State 1: Reset
•State 2: Five
•State 3: Ten
•State 4: Fifteen
•State 5: Twenty
•State 6: Twenty Five
The machine only accepts the following coins
•Rs. 5 (nickel)
•Rs. 10 (dime)
•Rs. 25 (quarter)
Whenever we get a coin we jump to the next state. So for example, if we get a 
coin from the reset state, say a Rs. 5 coin, then we jump to the next state Five . 
Otherwise we stay in the same state. When we get Extra amount we  come back
to the reset state and the difference is given back to the user.

### **Verilog Code**
```v
module vending_machine(
  output reg vend,
  output reg [2:0] change,state,
  input [2:0] coin,

And with this we have come to the end of the manual for Finite State Machines.
Up next, you will learning the implementation of a Single Cycle MIPS 
Processor. Hopefully this manual helped in broadening your understanding of 
Finite State Machines from a very basic to a fairly advanced level. You’ll be 
required to implement these concepts again in the Practice Questions.
