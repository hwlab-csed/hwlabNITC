#### **Setting Up MARS Simulator**
 *__Note: Is your MARS text unreadably small? Download and use a 
new release Java 9 or above which contains a fix to automatically 
scale and size AWT and Swing components for High Dots Per Inch 
(HiDPI) displays on Windows and Linux.__*  

##### **Downloading MIPS MARS Simulator on macOS:**
1. Open a web browser on your macOS computer.
